# almighty-handbook-of-sleep-deprived-student

Hello, fellow EPFL students! Or, people from all around the world, I don't know. 
Welcome to the Almighty Handbook of the Sleep-Deprived Student! (bit of a long repo name, I know, might change it very soon.)

The initial file that sparked the idea for this repository was a summary that I created about a first-year analysis class. I wanted to share it with my fellow students, and thought that the best way was to create a place where anyone could create, update or get anything resource about classes given here at EPFL, where everything would be made by students, for students. We are all in this together, after all.

My ideal would be that documents should be written in the LaTeX language, simply because it gives very nice results when it comes to writing mathematical formulae and scientific texts in general. The best part about learning LaTeX is that it will most likely help you later on in your career, as it is quite popular in the scientific world. Plus, it is not very complicated: only a few basics are needed to write a professional-looking summary. There are, however, no restrictions on the formats, and any contribution will be very, very welcome!

The repository might be quite empty at the start, but I do hope that it will help other students anyways. Never be afraid of submitting something if you think that it can be helpful to others!

And, most importantly, please enjoy the repository, and good luck with your studies!

### Q: I would like to participate, but do not know how to use LaTeX. HELP!
LaTeX is much easier than what you probably think! It is really always the same kind of syntax, and the online documentation is very complete. There are a few websites that could help you with the basics:
 - https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1617396-redigez-des-documents-de-qualite-avec-latex/1620583-les-mathematiques (in French)
 - https://www.overleaf.com/learn has great documentation, especially about writing maths
 
These two should get you started pretty well. As I said, you really do not need much in terms of basics. Once you've started writing a bit, you'll get the jist of it really quick. And, as always, if you run into any error or do not know how to do something, google it! I'm nearly positive you'll find what you're looking for.

### Q: What editor should I use for LaTeX?
Any, really. You could use a basic text editor like notepad++ and then compile into a pdf through the command line, as long as you have a compiler installed. There are also good IDE options like MiKTeX (Windows) and MaCTeX (Mac), that allow you to compile directly from the text editor. Here are the links:
 - https://miktex.org/ (This is the compiler I use, really good option. It comes with TeXworks and you just ctrl+T to compile your code. It might also work on Mac)
 - http://www.tug.org/mactex/ (for Mac, I know less about that one)
Or, you can find an option that fits you better by yourself.

### Q: I want to share some notes to this repository, where should I put it and how should I name it?
Thank you very much for your interest! The tree organization of this repository is quite straight-forward: you just have to go into the folder of the semester then into the folder of the class that the notes are about, and put your notes there. 

The best way to name your file in order to keep the repository ordered is the following:

`<the professor's last name>-<your last name>-<the type of document this is>`
  
For example, if I (Benjamin Bovey) wrote notes in French in LaTeX for Anna Lachowska's class of "Analyse 1" for the first semester of bachelor of IC:
Lachowska-Bovey-resume.tex
Lachowska-Bovey-resume.pdf
Please keep all characters simple ASCII, and do not leave any empty spaces in the names, as it makes it harder to deal with using Git. Replace spaces by hyphens "-".
