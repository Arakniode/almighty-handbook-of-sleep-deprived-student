# almighty-handbook-of-sleep-deprived-student

Hello, fellow EPFL students! Or, people from all around the world, I don't know. 
Welcome to the Almighty Handbook of the Sleep-Deprived Student! (bit of a long repo name, I know, might change it very soon.)

The initial file that sparked the idea for this repository was a summary that I created about a first-year analysis class. I wanted to share it with my fellow students, and thought that the best way was to create a place where anyone could create, update or get anything resource about classes given here at EPFL, where everything would be made by students, for students. We are all in this together, after all.

So, please enjoy the repository, and good luck with your studies!
