# almighty-handbook-of-sleep-deprived-student

Hello, fellow EPFL students! Or, people from all around the world, I don't know. 
Welcome to the Almighty Handbook of the Sleep-Deprived Student! (bit of a long repo name, I know, might change it very soon.)

The initial file that sparked the idea for this repository was a summary that I created about a first-year analysis class. I wanted to share it with my fellow students, and thought that the best way was to create a place where anyone could create, update or get anything resource about classes given here at EPFL, where everything would be made by students, for students. We are all in this together, after all.

My ideal would be that documents should be written in the LaTeX language, simply because it gives very nice results when it comes to writing mathematical formulae and scientific texts in general. The best part about learning LaTeX is that it will most likely help you later on in your career, as it is quite popular in the scientific world. Plus, it is not very complicated: only a few basics are needed to write a professional-looking summary. There are, however, no restrictions on the formats, and any contribution will be very, very welcome!

The repository might be quite empty at the start, but I do hope that it will help other students anyways. Never be afraid of submitting something if you think that it can be helpful to others!

And, most importantly, please enjoy the repository, and good luck with your studies!
